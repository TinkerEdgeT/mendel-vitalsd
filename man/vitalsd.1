vitalsd \- daemon to monitor vital system statistics

.B vitalsd
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
vitalsd is a very simple tool that samples vital system statistics (CPU load,
free/total memory, temperatures, etc.) and outputs them periodically to a serial
port. It's designed to be used on embedded systems with physical serial ports
that can crash in unexpected ways that leave the system in a non-triageable
state.
